                <h4>Communication Specilaist, BHSECQ</h4>
                <p>I specialized in advertising for Bard Diverse Network of Action (DNA). For any event sponsored by DNA I would create posters to hang around school.

                <h4>Smart Scholars, BHSECQ</h4>
                <p>Over a three week intensive, I helped students from different social backgrounds adjust to Bard community and work. Smart Scholars is a program that helps students get a feeling of the possible amount of work they will receive once the school year starts, as well as how classes will be formatted.

                <h4>Writopia, Upper West Manhattan</h4>
                <p>Served as a positive role model to younger kids by inspiring them to write their own stories. Aided whenever they had a writer's block through communication and suggestions. I learned how to interact with young individuals with special needs and how to deal with their frustration or triggers. Helped create comfort between students to have an inviting atmosphere. Helped the teacher distribute snacks to students in an orderly manner. </p>

                <h4>Catholic Charities, Astoria Queens</h4>
                <p>I would help tutor younger kids with their homework, exams, and class work. Whenever their homework was done I would help the teacher set up an activity for them to do and bring out snacks for them to take. Whenever holidays were around I would assist the teacher in coming up with activities and party ideas for the occasion. I would some days stay in the office picking up calls or giving calls to inform parents about upcoming events. </p>
